# Operator Name: `combineWith`

**Category:** Combination (custom generic operator)

## **Type Signature**

combineWith: <T, U, R>(other$: Observable<U>, combiner: (value1: T, value2: U) => R) => Observable<R>

- **`T`**: Type of the values emitted by the source Observable.
- **`U`**: Type of the values emitted by the `other$` Observable.
- **`R`**: Type of the result produced by combining values from the two Observables using `combiner`.

### **Purpose**

The `combineWith` operator is a custom generic RxJS combination operator that allows you to combine two Observables in a flexible way. It serves as a generalized alternative to operators like `combineLatest`, `concat`, `merge`, `zip`, etc., depending on the combination strategy defined in the `combiner` function.

### **Usage**

`combineWith` can be used to flexibly combine two streams of data in a manner that best fits your use case. You can control the emission behavior based on the `combiner` function that is provided.

### **Example Usage**

#### **Example 1: Combining Values with Addition**

In this example, we combine two Observables emitting numbers by adding them together.

```typescript
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { combineWith } from './operators/combineWith';

const obs1$ = of(1, 2, 3);
const obs2$ = of(4, 5, 6);

const combined$ = obs1$.pipe(
  combineWith(obs2$, (value1, value2) => value1 + value2)
);

combined$.subscribe(console.log);

**Output:**

5
7
9
```

#### **Example 2: Combining User and Role Streams**

This example combines user data from one Observable with role data from another Observable to create a more comprehensive user profile object.

```typescript
import { of } from 'rxjs';
import { combineWith } from './operators/combineWith';

const user$ = of({ id: 1, name: 'Alice' });
const role$ = of({ role: 'Admin' });

const userProfile$ = user$.pipe(
  combineWith(role$, (user, role) => ({ ...user, ...role }))
);

userProfile$.subscribe(console.log);

**Output:**

{ id: 1, name: 'Alice', role: 'Admin' }


### **Behavior**
- `combineWith` listens to both source and `other$` Observables.
- When both Observables emit a value, the provided `combiner` function is applied to the latest emitted values from each Observable.
- It outputs a new Observable that emits values produced by the `combiner` function.

### **Comparison to Built-in Operators**
- **`combineLatest`**: Emits when any source emits, combining the latest values.
- **`zip`**: Combines values pair-wise, similar to `combineWith` but always in a zipper-like sequence.
- **`merge`**: Merges emissions without combining them, unlike `combineWith` which actively applies the `combiner` function.

`combineWith` allows for more customizability by using a function to combine values, making it more versatile.

### **Common Use-Cases**
- Merging user inputs from different form fields and combining them into one coherent object.
- Combining data streams from multiple APIs into a unified data structure.
- Synchronizing events that occur in different parts of an application, such as user actions and application state updates.

### **Caveats**
- `combineWith` requires both Observables to emit at least once before emitting combined values.
- The `combiner` function should handle the types and logic carefully to avoid runtime errors.

### **Error Handling**
The operator is designed to catch and handle errors within each stream gracefully. Consider using a `catchError` strategy within the `combiner` logic if combining certain values could lead to an error.
